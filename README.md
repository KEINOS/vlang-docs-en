# Vlang Documentation <sup><sup><sub>CLONE</sub></sup></sup>

This repository is a __clone of only the `doc` directory__ of the [original V's repository](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md). It is __used to keep track of sources for translating the documents__ into other languages.

- Currently tracking files:
  - [./docs.md](docs.md)
  - [./upcomming.md](upcomming.md)
  - [./vscode.md](vscode.md)
  - [./LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)
  - [./img/vscode-debugger.png](img)

> __Note__:
>
> - The above files are synced with the [original repository](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/doc) every 24 hours. If you wish to fix these files, then submit them to the [original repository](https://github.com/vlang/v) first. After the PR is merged, this repository will be updated automatically.

## Section Chunked Files

The below directories contains fragmented version of the original file. Each file is divided into sections. This makes it easier to divide up the translation work and track changes as they occur.

However, the mirroring of the original changes is done manually. It would be helpful if you could PR any areas that are not tracked.
